Business processes are a crucial component within ICT to make clear how a situation is structured for the product produced thereafter. Taking the process of IO regarding searching for colleagues as an example, as seen below, the process for the task is not very efficient. When searching for a colleague, you have to scour each floor for the respective colleague, only to find out later that this colleague is on a day off.

To simplify this process, we at Colleak have undertaken the task of creating a colleague tracker. Through the use of WiFi tracking, it should be possible to determine firstly whether the colleague is actually on-site, and secondly, when the colleague is on-site, to identify the router closest to the person. Below, you will find the simplified process for IO regarding the search for a colleague.

# Userstory mapping
User Story Mapping is an agile method that provides product teams with insight into the relationship between user stories and the goals of a product. It helps teams better understand the value of their product, including customer needs, and how their product contributes to the goals of their organization. User Story Mapping is a powerful tool that enables teams to visualize product strategies and designs, build their products faster, and create better experiences.

## User-Story Mapping in 3 Steps

A user-story map represents three types of actions at different granularities: activities (the most general actions), steps, and details (the most specific actions). User activities and steps are horizontally displayed at the top of the map, and details stack vertically beneath their respective steps in priority order.

Activities represent the high-level tasks that users want to complete in the digital product - for example, "Check balance" or "Deposit a check." Depending on the type of application or website you are creating, you may have only a few high-value activities. These can appear in sequential order or in parallel if different paths exist for different users. Research on top user tasks should inform this level of the map.

Steps are directly below activities and also appear in sequential order. They represent the specific sub-tasks that users need to go through within the product to complete the activity above. For example, the activity "Deposit a check" can be broken down into steps such as "Enter mobile deposit details," "Sign the check," "Photograph the check," "Submit deposit," and "Confirm deposit."

Details are the third level of the story map and describe the lowest granularity interactions the team expects users to experience to complete the step above. For example, "Enter username or email" and "Enter password" appear as two separate details under the step "Sign In."
